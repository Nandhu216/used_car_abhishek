USED CAR MARKETPLACE – PROJECT REPORT
1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

Project Title: Used Car Marketplace System
Tech Stack: MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)

The Used Car Marketplace is a web-based application designed to connect buyers and sellers of used cars on a single digital platform. The system allows users to list cars for sale, browse available vehicles, and contact sellers easily. It aims to make the used car buying and selling process more transparent, efficient, and user-friendly.

2. PROBLEM STATEMENT

Currently, buying and selling used cars is mostly done through dealers, classified ads, or word-of-mouth.

Buyers face issues such as lack of accurate information, hidden costs, and difficulty comparing options.

Sellers struggle to reach genuine buyers and often depend on middlemen who charge high commissions.

There is no centralized platform to manage listings, verify details, and communicate efficiently.

3. PROPOSED SOLUTION

The proposed system is an online Used Car Marketplace where:

Sellers can list their used cars with complete details and images.

Buyers can browse, search, and filter cars based on their preferences.

The admin manages users and listings to ensure quality and reliability.

Direct communication between buyers and sellers reduces dependency on middlemen.
